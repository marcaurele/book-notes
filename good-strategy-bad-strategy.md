# Good Strategy Bad Strategy

## Introduction

### Overwhelming obstacles

* Simply being ambitious is not a strategy.
* Bad strategy ignores the power of choice and focus, trying instead to accommodate a multitude of conflicting demands and interests.
* Bad strategy covers up its failure to guide by embracing the language of broad goals, ambition, vision, and values.
* "strategy" should mean a cohesive response to an important challenge.
* A good strategy has an essential logical structure that I call the *kernel*. The kernel of a strategy contains three elements: a diagnosis, a guiding policy, and coherent action.
* Our education system is rich with targets and standards, but poor in comprehending and countering the sources of underperformance.

## Part I - Good and bad strategy

### Chapter 1 - Good strategy is unexpected

* Many organizations, most of the time, have multiple goals and initiatives that symbolize progress, but no coherent approach to accomplishing that progress other than *"spend more and try harder"*.
* Good strategy requires leaders who are willing and able to say *no* to a wide variety of actions and interests.

### Chapter 3 - Bad strategy

* To detect a bad strategy, look for one or more of its four major hallmarks:
  * ***Fluff.*** Fluff is a form of gibberish masquerading as strategic concepts or arguments. It uses "Sunday" words (words that are inflated and unnecessarily abstruse) and apparently esoteric concepts to create the illusion of high-level thinking.
  * ***Failure to face the challenge.*** Bad strategy fails to recognize or define the challenge. When you cannot define the challenge, you cannot evaluate a strategy or improve it.
  * ***Mistaking goals for strategy.*** Many bad strategies are just statements of desire rather than plans for overcoming obstacles.
  * ***Bad strategic objectives.*** A strategic objective is set by a leader as a means to an end. Strategic objectives are "bad" when they fail to address critical issues or when they are impracticable.
* *If you fail to identify and analyze the obstacles, you don't have a strategy. Instead you have either a stretch goal, a budget, or a list of things you wish would happen.
* The purpose of good strategy is to offer a potentially achievable way of surmounting a key challenge.
* *When a leader characterizes the challenge as underperformance, it sets the stage for bad strategy. Underperformance is a result. The true challenges are the reasons for the underperformance.*
* Bad strategy generates a feeling of dull annoyance when you have to listen to it or read it.

### Chapter 4 - Why so much bad strategy?

* Bad strategy is the active avoidance of the hard work crafting a good strategy. One common reason for choosing avoidance is the pain or difficulty of choice. A second pathway to bad strategy is the siren song of template-style strategy.
* Strategy involves focus and. therefore, choice. And choice means setting aside some goals in favor of others. When this hard work is not done, weak amorphous strategy is the result.
* Universal buy-in usually signals the absence of choice.
* Effective leadership doesn't depend on charisma. Reduction of the charisma leadership to a formula: the transformational leader (1) develops or has a vision, (2) inspires people to sacrifice (change) for the good of the organization, and (3) empowers people to accomplish the vision.

### Chapter 5 - The kernel of good strategy

* Good strategy is coherent action backed up by an argument, an effective mixture of thought and action with a basic underlying structure I call the *kernel*.
* The kernel of a strategy contains three elements:
  1. A *diagnosis* that defines or explains the nature of the challenge. A good strategy diagnosis simplifies the often overwhelming complexity of reality by identifying certain aspects of the situation as critical.
  2. A *guiding policy* for dealing with the challenge. This is an overall approach chosen to cope with or overcome the obstacles identified in the diagnosis.
  3. A set of *coherent actions* that are designed to carry out the guiding policy. These are steps that are coordinated with one another to work together in accomplishing the guiding policy.
* The guiding policy directs and constraints action without fully defining its content.
* A guiding policy creates advantage by anticipating the actions and reactions of others, by *reducing the complexity and ambiguity* in the situation, by exploiting the *leverage* inherent in concentrating effort on a pivotal or decisive aspect of the situation, and by creating policies and actions that are *coherent*, each building on the other rather than cancelling one another out.

## Part II - Sources of power

### Chapter 9 - Using design

* When the profits roll in, leaders will point to their every action with pride.
* It is the *disconnect* between current results and current action that makes the analysis of the sources of success so hard and, ultimately, so rewarding.
* Success leads to laxity and bloat, and these lead to decline.
* Relying on the profits accruing to accumulated resources, they will lose the discipline of tight integration, allowing independent fiefdoms to flourish and adding so many products and projects that integration becomes impossible.
* When their resource base eventually becomes obsolete, they, too, will become prey to another generation upstarts.

### Chapter 11 - Growth

* The problem with engineering growth by acquisition is that when you buy a company, especially a public company, you usually pay too much. You pay a premium over its ordinary market value - usually about 25 percent - plus fees. If you have friendly investment bankers and lenders, you can grow as fast as you like by acquisition. But unless you can buy companies for less than they are worth, or unless you are specially positioned to add more value to the target than anyone else can, no value is created by such expansion.

### Chapter 12 - Using advantage

* It is the leader's job to identify which asymmetries are critical - which can be turned into important advantages.
* Gilbreth's lesson, still fresh today, is that incentives alone are not enough. One must reexamine each aspect of product and process, casting aside the comfortable assumption that everyone knows what they are doing.

### Chapter 13 - Using dynamics

* To make good bets on how a wave of change will play out you must acquire enough expertise to question the experts. As changes begin to occur, the air will be full of comments about what is happening, but you must be able to dif beneath that surface and discover the fundamental forces at work.

### Chapter 14 - Inertia and entropy

* The first step in breaking organizational culture inertia is simplification.
* After the first round of simplification, it may be necessary to fragment the operating units.
* The purpose of the challenge is not performance per se, but building new work habits and routines within the unit.
* Once the bulk of operating units are working well, it may then be time to install a new overlay of coordinating mechanisms, reversing some of the fragmented that was used to break inertia.

### Chapter 15 - Putting it together

* Intelligent anticipation, a guiding policy that reduced complexity, the power of design, focus, using advantage, riding a dynamic wave of change, and the important role played by the inertia and disarray of rivals.
* Nvidia case: the first step in executing the guiding policy was the establishment of three separate development teams. Each would work to an eighteen-month start-to-market cycle.

## Part III - Thinking like a strategist

### Chapter 16 - The science os strategy

* To generate a strategy, one must put aside the comfort and security of pure deduction and launch into the murkier waters of induction, analogy, judgment, and insight.

### Chapter 17 - Using your head

* When we attend to one set of issues, we lose sight of another.
* People can forget their larger purposes, distracted by the pull of immediate events.
* Making a list of "things to do, *now*" rather than "things to worry about" forces us to resolve concerns into actions.
* Our own myopia is the obstacle common to all strategic situations.
* Being strategic is being less myopic - less shortsighted - than others. You must perceive and take into account what others do not, be they colleagues or rivals. Being less myopic is not the same as pretending you can see the future. You must work with the facts on the ground, not the vague outlines of the distant future. Whether it is insight into industry structures and trends, anticipating the actions and reactions of competitors, insight into your own competencies and resources, or stretching your own thinking to cover more of the bases and resist your own biases, being "strategic" largely means being less myopic than your undeliberative self.
* Most people, most of the time, solve problems by grabbing the first solution that pops into their heads - the first insight.
* Our instincts can often produce amazingly good judgments. But our instincts also tell us, incorrectly, that our instincts are always right.
* When we do come up with an idea, we tend to spend most of our effort justifying it rather than questioning it. That seems to be human nature, even in experienced executives. To put it simply, our minds dodge the painful work of questioning and letting go of our first early judgments, and we are not conscious of the dodge.
* To guide your own thinking in strategy work, you must cultivate three essential skills or habits. First, you must have a variety of tools for fighting your own myopia and for guiding your own attention. Second, you must develop the ability to question your own judgments so that you can improve.
* A new alternative should flow from a reconsideration of the facts of the situation, and it should also address the weaknesses of any already developed alternatives. The creation of new higher-quality alternatives requires that one try hard to "destroy" any existing alternatives, exposing their fault lines and internal contradictions. I call this discipline *create-destroy*.
* Thinking through how a particular well-remembered expert might respond to a problem can be a richer source of criticism and advice than abstract theories or frameworks.
* In business and politics, and in many aspects of military strategy, most of the important judgments are about people, especially anticipating their actions and reactions.
