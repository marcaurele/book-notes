# Book Notes

Notes from books that I have read.

## Table of Contents

* [Good Strategy Bad Strategy](good-strategy-bad-strategy.md) by Richard Rumelt

## Information

While reading I have a pen to underline the notes I want to keep on a hardcover book.

Not all chapters of books have notes because I did not feel they contained relevant information.
