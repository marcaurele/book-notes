# On Writing Well

## Introduction

* Nobody told all the new computer writers that the essence of writing is rewriting. Just because they’re writing fluently doesn’t mean they’re writing well.

## Part I: Principles

### 2 - Simplicity

* Clutter is the disease of American writing. We are a society strangling in unnecessary words, circular constructions, pompous frills and meaningless jargon.
* But the secret of good writing is to strip every sentence to its cleanest components. Every word that serves no function, every long word that could be a short word, every adverb that carries the same meaning that’s already in the verb, every passive construction that leaves the reader unsure of who is doing what—these are the thousand and one adulterants that weaken the strength of a sentence. And they usually occur in proportion to education and rank.
* Writers must therefore constantly ask: what am I trying to say? Surprisingly often they don’t know. Then they must look at what they have written and ask: have I said it? Is it clear to someone encountering the subject for the first time? If it’s not, some fuzz has worked its way into the machinery. The clear writer is someone clearheaded enough to see this stuff for what it is: fuzz.

### 3 - Clutter

* Fighting clutter is like fighting weeds—the writer is always slightly behind.
* Be grateful for everything you can throw away. Reexamine each sentence you put on paper. Is every word doing new work? Can any thought be expressed with more economy? Is anything pompous or pretentious or faddish? Are you hanging on to something useless just because you think it’s beautiful? Simplify, simplify.

### 5 - The Audience

* Soon after you confront the matter of preserving your identity, another question will occur to you: “Who am I writing for?” It’s a fundamental question, and it has a fundamental answer: You are writing for yourself.

### 6 - Words

* Make a habit of reading what is being written today and what was written by earlier masters. Writing is learned by imitation.

## Part II: Methods

### 8 - Unity

* The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.
* One choice is unity of pronoun.
* Unity is the anchor of good writing.
* Unity of tense is another choice.
* Another choice is unity of mood.
* Therefore ask yourself some basic questions before you start. For example: “In what capacity am I going to address the reader?” (Reporter? Provider of information? Average man or woman?) “What pronoun and tense am I going to use?” “What style?” (Impersonal reportorial? Personal but formal? Personal and casual?) “What attitude am I going to take toward the material?” (Involved? Detached? Judgmental? Ironic? Amused?) “How much do I want to cover?” “What one point do I want to make?”
* As for what point you want to make, every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five—just one. So decide what single point you want to leave in the reader’s mind.
* Trust your material if it’s taking you into terrain you didn’t intend to enter but where the vibrations are good. Adjust your style accordingly and proceed to whatever destination you reach. Don’t become the prisoner of a preconceived plan.

### 10 - Bits & Pieces

#### Verbs

* Use active verbs unless there is no comfortable way to get around using a passive verb.
* Make active verbs activate your sentences, and avoid the kind that need an appended preposition to complete their work. Don’t set up a business that you can start or launch. Don’t say that the president of the company stepped down. Did he resign? Did he retire? Did he get fired? Be precise. Use precise verbs.

#### Adverbs

* Most adverbs are unnecessary. You will clutter your sentence and annoy the reader if you choose a verb that has a specific meaning and then add an adverb that carries the same meaning.

#### Adjectives

* Most adjectives are also unnecessary. Like adverbs, they are sprinkled into sentences by writers who don’t stop to think that the concept is already in the noun.

#### Little Qualifiers

* Prune out the small words that qualify how you feel and how you think and what you saw: “a bit,” “a little,” “sort of,” “kind of,” “rather,” “quite,” “very,” “too,” “pretty much,” “in a sense” and dozens more. They dilute your style and your persuasiveness.

#### Punctuation

* If you find yourself hopelessly mired in a long sentence, it’s probably because you’re trying to make the sentence do more than it can reasonably do—perhaps express two dissimilar thoughts.
* The Dash. Somehow this invaluable tool is widely regarded as not quite proper. The dash is used in two ways. One is to amplify or justify in the second part of the sentence a thought you stated in the first part. The other use involves two dashes, which set apart a parenthetical thought within a longer sentence.

#### Writing Is Not A Contest

* Every writer is starting from a different point and is bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with everybody else who is trying to write and presumably doing it better.
* Forget the competition and go at your own pace. Your only contest is with yourself.

#### The Quickest Fix

* Surprisingly often a difficult problem in a sentence can be solved by simply getting rid of it.

#### Paragraphs

* Keep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual—it catches the eye before it has a chance to catch the brain.

#### Sexism

* One of the most vexing new questions for writers is what to do about sexist language, especially the “he-she” pronoun.
* One solution is to find another term: “chair” for “chairman,” “company representative” for “spokesman.”
* This still leaves the bothersome pronoun. “He” and “him” and “his” are words that rankle.
* One solution is to turn them into the plural. But this is good only in small doses. A style that converts every “he” into a “they” will quickly turn to mush.
* Another common solution is to use “or”: “Every employee should decide what he or she thinks is best for him or her.” But again, it should be used sparingly.

#### Rewriting

* Rewriting is the essence of writing well: it’s where the game is won or lost. That idea is hard to accept.
* The point is that clear writing is the result of a lot of tinkering.

## Part III: Forms

### 13 - Writing About Places

* The terrible work has nothing to do with some terrible flaw of character. On the contrary, it results from the virtue of enthusiasm. Nobody turns so quickly into a bore as a traveler home from his travels. He enjoyed his trip so much that he wants to tell us all about it—and “all” is what we don’t want to hear. We only want to hear some.
* The other big trap is style. Nowhere else in nonfiction do writers use such syrupy words and groaning platitudes. Adjectives you would squirm to use in conversation—“wondrous,” “dappled,” “roseate,” “fabled,” “scudding”—are common currency.
* To write that “the city has its own attractiveness” is no help. And who will define “charm,” except the owner of a charm school? Or “romantic”? These are subjective concepts in the eye of the beholder. One man’s romantic sunrise is another man’s hangover.
* First, choose your words with unusual care. If a phrase comes to you easily, look at it with deep suspicion; it’s probably one of the countless clichés that have woven their way so tightly into the fabric of travel writing that you have to make a special effort not to use them.
* As for substance, be intensely selective.

### 15 - Science and Technology

* Writing is thinking on paper.

### 16 - Business Writing

* Many of those people are managers whose writing goes out to the public: the president addressing the stockholders, the banker explaining a change in procedure, the school principal writing a newsletter to parents. Whoever they are, they tend to be so afraid of writing that their sentences lack all humanity—and so do their institutions. It’s hard to imagine that these are real places where real men and women come to work every morning.
* Information can be imparted clearly and without pomposity.
* We are suspicious of pretentiousness, of all the fad words that the social scientists have coined to avoid making themselves clear to ordinary mortals. I urged them to be natural. How we write and how we talk is how we define ourselves.
* I recited my four articles of faith: clarity, simplicity, brevity and humanity.
* Still, plain talk will not be easily achieved in corporate America. Too much vanity is on the line. Managers at every level are prisoners of the notion that a simple style reflects a simple mind. Actually a simple style is the result of hard work and hard thinking; a muddled style reflects a muddled thinker or a person too arrogant, or too dumb, or too lazy to organize his thoughts. Remember that what you write is often the only chance you’ll get to present yourself to someone whose business or money or good will you need. If what you write is ornate, or pompous, or fuzzy, that’s how you’ll be perceived. The reader has no other choice.
* They replied that this was easier said than done in hierarchical corporations, where approval of written reports is required at a succession of higher levels. I sensed an undercurrent of fear: do things the company way and don’t risk your job trying to make the company human.
* What I realized was that most executives in America don’t write what appears over their signature or what they say in their speeches. They have surrendered the qualities that make them unique.
* Preoccupied with their high technology, they forget that some of the most powerful tools they possess—for good and for bad—are words.
* If you work for an institution, whatever your job, whatever your level, be yourself when you write. You will stand out as a real person among the robots, and your example might even persuade Thomas Bell to write his own stuff.

### 18 - Writing About the Arts

* But to say why you think a play is good, in words that don’t sound banal, is one of the hardest chores in the business.
* Yet I suggest several conditions that apply to both good reviewing and good criticism.
* One is that critics should like—or, better still, love—the medium they are reviewing. If you think movies are dumb, don’t write about them. The reader deserves a movie buff who will bring along a reservoir of knowledge, passion and prejudice. It’s not necessary for the critic to like every film; criticism is only one person’s opinion. But he should go to every movie wanting to like it. If he is more often disappointed than pleased, it’s because the film has failed to live up to its best possibilities. This is far different from the critic who prides himself on hating everything. He becomes tiresome faster than you can say “Kafkaesque.”
* Another rule is: don’t give away too much of the plot. Tell readers just enough to let them decide whether it’s the kind of story they tend to enjoy, but not so much that you’ll kill their enjoyment.
* A third principle is to use specific detail. This avoids dealing in generalities, which, being generalities, mean nothing.
* A final caution is to avoid the ecstatic adjectives that occupy such disproportionate space in every critic’s quiver—words like “enthralling” and “luminous.” Good criticism needs a lean and vivid style to express what you observed and what you think.
* Some arts are harder to catch in print than others. One is dance, which consists of movement. How can a writer freeze all the graceful leaps and pirouettes? Another is music. It’s an art that we receive through our ears, yet writers are stuck with describing it in words we will see.

## Part IV: Attitudes

### 20 - The Sound of Your Voice

* Never hesitate to imitate another writer. Imitation is part of the creative process for anyone learning an art or a craft.
* Find the best writers in the fields that interest you and read their work aloud. Get their voice and their taste into your ear—their attitude toward language. Don’t worry that by imitating them you’ll lose your own voice and your own identity. Soon enough you will shed those skins and become who you are supposed to become.

### 24 - Writing Family History and Memoir

* Be yourself and your readers will follow you anywhere. Try to commit an act of writing and your readers will jump overboard to get away. Your product is you. The crucial transaction in memoir and personal history is the transaction between you and your remembered experiences and emotions.
